as a user, after first login, I wanna give my basic infos and bills.
Once i have entered all my infos, I click on Save.

Once I click on save, a modal opens up:
    Model desribes 3 States:
        1- On Success, redirecting you to your dashboard in 3,2,1
        2- Loading: Still waiting for server response 
        3- Some Error, show button to close modal, and stay on onBoarding Page 

    How to achieve:
        - Prepare a generic Modal component that takes callbacks
